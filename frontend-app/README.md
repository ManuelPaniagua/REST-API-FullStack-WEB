# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
 
 # Configuration

 This frontend project assumes it connects to the backend server hosted at REST-APIs-FULLSTACK Repository. https://github.com/ManuelPaniagua/REST-API-FullStack/ Ensure the server is running and accessible during development and deployment.

 # Run
 npm run dev
